# mev2 - Personal Portfolio using Bootstrap

## Project Overview 

This repository contains the second major iteration of my personal portfolio website, developed as part of the requirements for Lab 4: Update your portfolio using Bootstrap.

The main objective of this update was to elevate the look and structure of the portfolio by incorporating modern, responsive design principles using **Bootstrap**.

## Technologies Used 

This project is built using standard web technologies and the Bootstrap framework:

* **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For custom styling and minor adjustments.
* **Bootstrap 5:** Used extensively for:
    * Responsive Grid System.
    * Pre-styled components (e.g., Navbar, Cards, Buttons).
    * Ensuring an excellent user experience across all devices.
* **Git & GitHub:** Used for version control and hosting the repository.
